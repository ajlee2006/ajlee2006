### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andrew, a student in Singapore, but my username is AndewMole on most sites. I can program in Python (which I use most) as well as basic Java and HTML/CSS/JS (if I'm forced to lol). I'm not very active here but I do make some small stuff on [replit](https://replit.com/@AJLee/). I speak Chinese and know a bit of toki pona and Esperanto too

[Subscribe to my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/andewmole) where I write/arrange music and other stuff
